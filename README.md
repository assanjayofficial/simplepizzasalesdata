# simplepizzasalesdata
Hello, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Jay, and I am someone who is fairly new to the world of data analysis. Today, I would like to share a fairly simple Pizza Sales Data Analyst Dashboard. Inside this dashboard, there are only 4 menus, such as: Total Sales Pizza (Based on Size, Category, Total Sales), Peak Sales Day, Popular Pizza, and Least Popular Pizza. Because I am still a beginner on this project, that's why I kept it as simple as possible. Hopefully, there will be better changes in the future (It's a little bit messy in the dashboard, LoL).
